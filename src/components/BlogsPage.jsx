      title: "Challenges or limitations associated with Large Language Models (LLM)",

       content: '🚀While exploring and learning this Generative AI field 🤖🌐 and after seeing some amazing applications on LLM. Question coming to mind that what all challenges or limitations associated with Large Language Models (LLM) could be there? So, I tried to find an answer to the question while in my learning journey. And here I found some of its challenges or limitations. 🧠💡<br /><br />🌐Lack of Real-world Understanding:<br /><br />LLMs often lack a true understanding of the world. They generate responses based on patterns learned during training but do not have genuine comprehension or common-sense reasoning which I believe is quite important. That’s why we need a fine tuning for custom dataset to get relevant responses. <br /><br />🤖 Bias and Fairness Issues:<br /><br />I always think LLM as train on huge data on internet they. So obviously they amplify and perpetuate biases present in their training data. If the training data is biased, the model can generate biased outputs. To make our model robust or application which build on LLM robust this is challenge we all need to address it. And I see huge research going on in this field.<br /><br />🗣️Contextual Ambiguity:<br /><br />Understanding and maintaining context over long conversations can be challenging for LLMs. They might lose track of the context or misunderstand user intent, leading to nonsensical or inappropriate responses. <br /><br />🤯Ethical Concerns:<br /><br />LLMs can be used to generate deceptive content, deepfakes, or maliciously manipulate information. This raises ethical concerns regarding the potential misuse of the tech<br /><br /> 💻Resource Intensive:<br /><br /> I guess this is a very common challenge everyone knows who is working in Generative AI field. Training and inferencing large language models require significant computational resources, making them inaccessible for many researchers and organizations. This also raises environmental concerns due to the high energy consumption, large CO2 emissions while training <br /><br />🌐Inability to Access External Knowledge:<br /><br /> LLMs typically lack the ability to access real-time information or external knowledge beyond their pre-training data. This can limit their usefulness in dynamic or rapidly changing contexts. <br /><br />🚨Generation of Incorrect or Unverified Information:<br /><br /> Everyone who has used this LLM and its application knows about it can generate responses that sometimes sound plausible but are factually incorrect or unverified. Users should be cautious when relying on LLMs for information. <br /><br />🎯Fine-tuning Challenges:<br /><br /> Fine-tuning LLMs for specific tasks can be challenging, it required research and understanding various concepts, and it may not always lead to  optimal performance. Fine-tuned models may still exhibit biases or generate unexpected outputs. let me know what your thought on this also if you know some more challenges or limitations of LLM write down in comment section. <br /><br />#GenerativeAI #AIChallenges hashtag#EthicalAI hashtag#InnovationInAI hashtag#AI hashtag#chatgpt hashtag#embedding hashtag#LLM hashtag#AI hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#FutureOfAI hashtag#stockholm hashtag#aicommunity '

        "🍏🔍✨ Exciting News from Apple: ReALM vs. GPT-4 🚀",
      //date: 'March 1, 2024',
      author: "Reenal Boddul",
      content:
        "Apple's latest breakthrough in AI, ReALM (Reference Resolution As Language Modeling), is turning heads in the tech world. In a recently released preprint paper, Apple researchers boldly claim that ReALM has the upper hand over OpenAI's GPT-4 in certain benchmarks, marking a significant leap forward in language understanding technology.<br /><br />  So  what exactly sets ReALM apart? Well, it's all about reference resolution — the ability to grasp precisely what a word or phrase is referring to in context. Picture this: you're chatting with a virtual assistant and casually mention that article I was reading earlier or the podcast playing in the background. While humans effortlessly understand such references, machines like chatbots often struggle. That is where ReALM shines.Apples vision for ReALM goes beyond mere text comprehension. They aim for a seamless user experience where you can interact with your device using natural language, pointing to objects on the screen, or referring to background activities, and ReALM gets it, perfectly.<br /><br /> In their paper, Apple researchers outline their ambitious goal of teaching ReALM to identify three types of entities: onscreen, conversational, and background. Whether it's a fitness schedule displayed on your phone, a conversation about your workout routine, or the music playing softly in the background, ReALM strives to understand it all.<br /><br />The results speak for themselves. According to the paper, ReALM outperforms existing systems and even surpasses GPT-4 in certain benchmarks. Impressive gains were observed, especially in understanding on-screen references. However, it's essential to note the conditions of the comparison: while GPT-4 utilized prompt+image inputs, ReALM's evaluation was based solely on text prompts. This nuance highlights the complexity of benchmarking different models and their respective capabilities.<br /><br />But let is not jump to conclusions just yet. While ReALM may have the edge in specific scenarios, it does not necessarily make it the superior model overall. Each AI has its strengths and limitations, and the comparison should be contextualized within the tasks they were designed for As Apple continues to innovate in the realm of AI, these papers serve as tantalizing glimpses into the future of iOS and macOS. While the integration of ReALM into Apple is products remains uncertain, one thing is clear: the race for AI supremacy is far from over, and Apple is determined to stay at the forefront.<br /><br />Stay tuned for more updates as the saga of ReALM vs. GPT-4 unfolds. The future of AI-driven interactions has never looked more intriguing. 🌟<br /><br /> Paper Link : https://lnkd.in/dDZ4fmGD<br /><br />hashtag#GenerativeAI hashtag#AIChallenges hashtag#EthicalAI hashtag#InnovationInAI hashtag#AI hashtag#chatgpt hashtag#ReALM hashtag#embedding hashtag#LLM hashtag#AI hashtag#TechInnovation hashtag#FutureOfAI hashtag#aicommunity",
